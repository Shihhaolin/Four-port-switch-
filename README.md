# Four-port-switch-
This project is basically from Cadence training course Essential Systemverilog for UVM. All copyright is from Cadence. The project only for my personal practice. 

The packet switch design has four port. The switch would get the data packets on a port and transmits the packet to one or more ports which depending on the packet data. If the data is Single packet, it would be sent to one port. If the data is Multicast packet, it would be sent to two or three port. If the data is Broadcast packet, it would be sent to all ports. Then use some SystemVerilog verification concept(Constranit , Randomization , Inheritance and Polymorphism) to designed a proper testbench with enough coverage.
